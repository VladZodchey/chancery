Ever wanted a self-hosted text file storage like Pastebin? No? Well, I did.

This piece has these neat features:
- Paste metadata, such as its filetype, author, creation type, additional custom fields.
- User/role system for fine-grained access control
- Read-protected (private) pastes
- ...and more to come!

Contributions are welcome!
I would really appreciate if someone with application security knowledge (and peaceful intent) reviewed the auth thingamabob I made.

Please note that this API is still in active pre-release development, things may break, things may change.
A ton of essential features are not yet implemented.
